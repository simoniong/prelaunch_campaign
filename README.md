# Why another prelauncher

* origin prelauncher use Rails 3.x, and seems never updated, I want it to be latest version of Rails.
* the layout for origin prelauncher is not responsive.
* origin prelauncher manage email list in database, but I need the flexibility to integrate with Newsletter Service like [Mailchimp](mailchimp.com) or just keep it that way to own database.
